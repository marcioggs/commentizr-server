# Commentizr

*This is the server application for this [Chrome Extension](https://github.com/marcioggs/commentizr-chrome-extension)*

It is not always simple to have access to other people's opinion about the
content of a web page. Sometimes this scenario happens because it's not interest of
the responsible for the page to facilitate this access, or it may happen also simply
because the responsible doesn't have the required technical knowledge, or merely
doesn't have time to create such functionality.
This project was developed with the aim of reducing these types of barriers,
making users more involved in the web and allowing them to share experiences on
any web pages.
The solution proposed here is a web browser extension, where the extension
customers can view the comments of another customers, independently if the web
page has similar functionality.
